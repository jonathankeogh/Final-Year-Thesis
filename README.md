# Intro-to-proj-geo-w-elliptic-curves
This is my final year thesis. It is an introduction to projective geometry, assuming only some basic algebra and complex analysis, with a development on the structure of elliptic curves. The appendix has a nice direct proof of Hilbert's Nustellensatz from the definitions.

I've lost the tex file, so all thats left is the pdf.
